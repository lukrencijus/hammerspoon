# Better Force Quit Applications 
(with background apps and search functionality)

This was written because I do not like "task managers" on Mac

We have "Force Quit Applications" (cmd + option + esc) but is it very basic and limited

We also have "Activity Monitor" but it takes a while to load

So this Hammerspoon script has a customizable hotkey to open it, includes search functionality, and also shows background applications

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The limitation is that some applications have extensions that also show up as applications, but without an icon

# Spotify in menu bar

Hides when Spotify is not open
