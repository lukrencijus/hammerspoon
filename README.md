# Better Force Quit Applications 
(with background apps and search functionality)

This was written because I do not like "task managers" on mac.

We have "Force Quit Applications" (cmd + option + esc) but is it very basic and limited. 

We also have "Activity Monitor" but it takes a while to load.

So this hammerspoon script has customizible hotkey to open it, has seach functionality and also shows background applications
